Modifiers are used to filter query results enabling powerful patterns. All modifiers can be mixed together.

## Not

The `Not` modifier excludes entities that have specific traits from the query results.

```js
import { Not } from 'koota'

const staticEntities = world.query(Position, Not(Velocity))
```

## Or

By default all query parameters are combined with logical AND. The `Or` modifier enables using logical OR instead.

```js
import { Or } from 'koota'

const movingOrVisible = world.query(Or(Velocity, Renderable))
```

## Added

The `Added` modifier tracks all entities that have added the specified traits or relations since the last time the query was run. A new instance of the modifier must be created for tracking to be unique.

```js
import { createAdded } from 'koota'

const Added = createAdded()

// Track entities that added the Position trait
const newPositions = world.query(Added(Position))

// Track entities that added a ChildOf relation
const newChildren = world.query(Added(ChildOf))

// After running the query, the Added modifier is reset
```

## Removed

The `Removed` modifier tracks all entities that have removed the specified traits or relations since the last time the query was run. This includes entities that have been destroyed. A new instance of the modifier must be created for tracking to be unique.

```js
import { createRemoved } from 'koota'

const Removed = createRemoved()

// Track entities that removed the Velocity trait
const stoppedEntities = world.query(Removed(Velocity))

// Track entities that removed a ChildOf relation
const orphaned = world.query(Removed(ChildOf))

// After running the query, the Removed modifier is reset
```

## Changed

The `Changed` modifier tracks all entities that have had the specified traits or relation stores change since the last time the query was run. A new instance of the modifier must be created for tracking to be unique.

```js
import { createChanged } from 'koota'

const Changed = createChanged()

// Track entities whose Position has changed
const movedEntities = world.query(Changed(Position))

// Track entities whose ChildOf relation data has changed
const updatedChildren = world.query(Changed(ChildOf))

// After running the query, the Changed modifier is reset
```

## Add, remove and change events

Koota allows you to subscribe to add, remove, and change events for specific traits.

- `onAdd` triggers when `entity.add()` is called after the initial value has been set on the trait.
- `onRemove` triggers when `entity.remove()` is called, but before any data has been removed.
- `onChange` triggers when an entity's trait value has been set with `entity.set()` or when it is manually flagged with `entity.changed()`.

```js
// Subscribe to Position changes
const unsub = world.onChange(Position, (entity) => {
  console.log(`Entity ${entity} changed position`)
})

// Subscribe to Position additions
const unsub = world.onAdd(Position, (entity) => {
  console.log(`Entity ${entity} added position`)
})

// Subscribe to Position removals
const unsub = world.onRemove(Position, (entity) => {
  console.log(`Entity ${entity} removed position`)
})

// Trigger events
const entity = world.spawn(Position)
entity.set(Position, { x: 10, y: 20 })
entity.remove(Position)
```

When subscribing to relations, callbacks receive `(entity, target)` so you know which relation pair changed. Relation `onChange` events are triggered by `entity.set(Relation(target), data)` and only on relations with data via the store prop.

```js
const Likes = relation()

const unsub = world.onAdd(Likes, (entity, target) => {
  console.log(`Entity ${entity} likes ${target}`)
})
```
